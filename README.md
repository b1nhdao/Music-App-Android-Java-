Since i passed this class, this repo won't have any update (unless i have to use it for another class). 
I know it's not perfect, it's absolutely trash compared to the other projects or apps, but it is what it is and i'm proud of my progress. I made this thing in less than a week, started from zero and that was a nightmare
